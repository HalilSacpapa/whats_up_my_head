# What's up my head
What's Up My Head is a program that aims at showing what is above the user, from commercial plane to satellite, including the International Space Station.
#
## First launch of the app
First of all in order to launch the app for the first time, you need to install the required node modules with the following commands :
```
npm install -g expo-cli
npm install
```
Then you should be able to launch the app like so :
```
npm run web
```
*Theses actions could take a while as all `expo`, `node` and `javascript` requirements are installed at once.*

The application should now run correctly at `http://localhost:19006`.
There is also a metro bundler console available at `http://localhost:19002`.
#
## Launch the app on iOS or Android mobile (development)
You can test your app either on an iPhone or an Android phone in just a few steps.

First, you will need to download the `Expo` app (available on both Apple Store and Google Play Store).

### **iOS**
Scan the QR code printed in the terminal where you launched the app. It should redirect you to the Expo app and run your application on it.

### **Android**
Start the Expo app and scan the QR code printed in the terminal where you launched the app. It should run your application directly on the Expo app.
